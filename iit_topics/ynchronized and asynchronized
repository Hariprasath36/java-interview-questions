Synchronized means that operations happen in a sequential or blocking manner, where one task must complete before another begins. In multithreading, synchronization is used to control access to shared resources, ensuring that only one thread can access the critical section (shared resource) at a time. This prevents race conditions (where multiple threads access and modify shared data simultaneously in an inconsistent manner).

Java provides the synchronized keyword to help synchronize methods or blocks of code to ensure thread-safe access.

Key Features:
Only one thread at a time can access a synchronized block or method.
It ensures thread safety when accessing shared resources.
It is often slower due to the overhead of acquiring and releasing locks.


Asynchronous (Asynchronized) Programming
Asynchronized (or asynchronous) programming means that tasks are executed concurrently and are non-blocking. Multiple tasks can run in parallel without waiting for each other to complete. This is useful when you want to perform I/O operations (like reading files or making network requests) or CPU-bound tasks in the background without blocking the main thread.

In asynchronous programming, you can initiate a task (like a network request), and it can continue running in the background while other tasks proceed. Once the background task completes, its result is returned.

Key Features:
Non-blocking: Tasks do not wait for others to finish and continue running in the background.
It allows concurrency without needing synchronization (as long as shared resources are not accessed by multiple threads).
It's more efficient for I/O-bound operations, like file access or database queries.
Often used in event-driven programming, callbacks, or using APIs like CompletableFuture and ExecutorService in Java.
