In Java, a Higher-Order Function (HOF) is a function that either:

Takes one or more functions as arguments, or
Returns a function as its result.
This concept is central to functional programming and is enabled in Java primarily through the use of lambdas and method references introduced in Java 8.

 Passing Functions as Arguments
Java allows passing functions (usually implemented using lambda expressions or method references) as arguments to other methods. 

Returning a Function
Java also allows a method to return a function. This can be done by returning a lambda expression or a method reference that matches a functional interface.

Key Concepts:
Lambda Expressions: These are used to create instances of functional interfaces in Java. A lambda is an anonymous function that can be passed around as a parameter.

Method References: You can also pass methods as arguments using method references.

Functional Interfaces:
In Java, functional interfaces like Function, Predicate, Consumer, and Supplier are often used in higher-order functions. They represent abstract operations that can be passed around.
