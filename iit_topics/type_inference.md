Type Inference in Java refers to the compiler's ability to automatically determine the type of a variable or expression, without explicit type declaration by the programmer. This feature simplifies the code and is particularly useful in situations where the type is obvious from the context.


 Type Inference with Local Variable Type (var) - Java 10
Starting from Java 10, the var keyword allows the compiler to infer the type of local variables based on the assigned value.

Type Inference in Generics (Java 5)
Type inference is used heavily with generics, especially after Java 7 introduced the diamond operator (<>), allowing the type to be inferred from the context.

Type Inference with Lambda Expressions (Java 8)
Java 8 introduced lambda expressions, where the target type (functional interface) is inferred by the compiler.

Type Inference with Method References (Java 8)
Method references in Java also make use of type inference.

 Type Inference in Generic Methods
Java allows you to use type inference with generic methods. The compiler can infer the generic type arguments.

Benefits of Type Inference
Improved readability: Reduces code verbosity and makes it more concise.
Type safety: Type inference does not compromise type safety. The compiler still ensures that types are consistent.

Limitations of Type Inference
Local scope only (var): Inference with var is limited to local variables, and it cannot be used for method parameters, return types, or class fields.
Ambiguity: In some cases, excessive use of var can make the code harder to understand since the type is not explicitly declared.
