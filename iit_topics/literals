In Java, literals are fixed values that are directly written into the code and represent the basic building blocks of constant data. These values do not change and are used to initialize variables or for constant expressions. Java supports various types of literals, depending on the data type, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, and booleans.

Integer Literals

Integer literals are used to represent whole numbers (both positive and negative).

Floating-Point Literals

Floating-point literals represent decimal values. These can be written with or without an exponent

Character Literals

Character literals represent a single character enclosed in single quotes

String Literals

String literals are a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes

Boolean Literals

Boolean literals represent only two possible values: true or false

Null Literal

null is a special literal used to indicate that an object reference doesnâ€™t point to any object.
