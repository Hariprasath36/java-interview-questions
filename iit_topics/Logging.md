Logging is a process of capturing and storing events, messages, or errors in an application while it runs. Java provides several logging frameworks and built-in libraries to log messages, making it easier to monitor, debug, and troubleshoot applications.

Why Logging is Used in Java
Debugging and Error Tracking: Logs help developers identify issues and bugs within the application by capturing detailed information about the program's execution flow.
Monitoring Application Behavior: Logging allows the monitoring of application health, performance, and behavior, making it easier to manage systems, especially in production environments.
Auditing: Logs can be used to track changes, user activities, or any system-level actions for security or compliance reasons.
Post-Mortem Analysis: If an application crashes, logs can help reconstruct the events leading to the failure, providing clues for root cause analysis.

Common Logging Frameworks in Java
java.util.logging: Java’s built-in logging package. It provides basic logging capabilities and is suitable for simple use cases.
SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java): A popular logging API that provides a simple abstraction over various logging frameworks (e.g., Log4j, Logback).
Log4j (Apache Log4j): A powerful and flexible logging framework that allows developers to define loggers, appenders, and layouts.
Logback: A successor to Log4j, with more features and better performance.

Logging Levels
Logging frameworks typically offer levels to categorize the severity of logs:

FINE / DEBUG: Detailed information for diagnosing issues.
INFO: Informational messages about the normal operation of the application.
WARNING / WARN: Potential issues or unusual situations that don’t interrupt the application.
SEVERE / ERROR: Critical issues that need immediate attention (e.g., exceptions, system failures).
FATAL (in some frameworks): Severe problems that cause the program to crash.

Level	Severity	Description
TRACE	Lowest	  Fine-grained information for debugging.
DEBUG	Low	      Debugging information helpful in development.
INFO	Medium 	  Informational messages about the normal operation.
WARN	High	  Potential issues that might need attention.
ERROR	Higher	  Serious errors that affect functionality.
FATAL	Highest	  Critical errors causing application crashes.

bult-in logging levels
SEVERE: The highest level, indicating serious failures.
WARNING: Indicates potential problems.
INFO: General information about the application's normal operations.
CONFIG: Configuration-level information, useful for debugging configuration settings.
FINE: A lower-level message, usually for detailed tracing information.
FINER: More detailed tracing, used for deeper debugging.
FINEST: The lowest level, providing the most detailed logging.

Why Levels are Important
Levels help control the verbosity of the logs, ensuring you can filter and retrieve only the relevant logs depending on the context (e.g., during development vs. in production).

Benefits of Using Logging
Real-Time Tracking: Developers can track the live status and operation of an application.
Visibility into Hidden Issues: Logging helps uncover issues that are not immediately apparent, especially in complex systems.
No Impact on Performance: Logs can be disabled or directed to different appenders (e.g., file, console, or remote server) without affecting application performance.
Structured Log Output: Logs can be formatted (JSON, XML) to make it easier for parsing and integration with monitoring tools.
