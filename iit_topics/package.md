a package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Packages help manage and modularize the code, preventing naming conflicts and making it easier to locate and use classes.

Key Points About Packages:
Organization: Packages group related classes and interfaces together. For example, the java.util package contains utility classes like ArrayList, HashMap, and Scanner.

Avoiding Name Conflicts: By placing classes in different packages, you avoid naming conflicts. For example, two classes named Date can coexist in different packages like java.util.Date and java.sql.Date.

Access Control: Packages provide access control. Classes within the same package can access each other's package-private members (those without an explicit access modifier). This allows for encapsulation within a package.

Importing: To use classes from other packages, you need to import them. This is done using the import statement:

import java.util.ArrayList; // Import a specific class
import java.util.*; // Import all classes from the java.util package

Package Declaration: The package name is declared at the very beginning of the Java source file:

package com.example.myapp; // Declare the package at the top of the file

Default Package: If no package is declared, the class is placed in the default package. It's generally recommended to avoid using the default package for larger projects, as it lacks organization and is not recommended for production cod
