three types 
*)implicit converting smaller datatype(int) into larger datatype(double) 
byte>short>int>long>float>double
char>int
we use = to change the type like int a=10;doubule b=a;

*)explicit converting larger datatype(double) into smaller datatype(int)
we use parathesis to cange 
eg:double a=10.1;int b=(int)a;

*)object-oriented when dealing with inheritance or interfaces, you may see downcasting or upcasting:
   1)upcasting -When you assign a subclass object to a superclass reference, it’s automatic.
   Animal animal = new Dog();  // Upcasting: Dog to Animal (implicit)

   2)downcasting -When you cast a superclass reference to a subclass, you need explicit casting.
   Dog dog = (Dog) animal;  // Downcasting: Animal to Dog (explicit)

There are three main types of wildcards:

Unbounded Wildcard (?)
Upper-Bounded Wildcard (? extends Type)
Lower-Bounded Wildcard (? super Type)


WRAPPER CLASS

A wrapper class in Java is a class that encapsulates (or "wraps") a primitive data type into an object. Java provides wrapper classes for all of its primitive types, allowing these types to be treated as objects when necessary. This is particularly useful in situations where Java requires objects, such as when working with collections like ArrayList, which can only hold objects, not primitives.

E	Element	 Used in collections, like List<E>
T	Type	 General-purpose type parameter
K	Key	     Used in key-value pairs (e.g., Map<K, V>)
V	Value	 Used in key-value pairs
N	Number	 Used for numeric types (e.g., Integer, Double)
S, U, etc.	 Additional types	For multi-type generics (e.g., Pair<T, U>)
?	Wildcard (unknown type)	Used to represent an unknown or bounded type
