Threading and multithreading are fundamental concepts in Java that allow you to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, making your programs more efficient, especially when dealing with complex or time-consuming operations. Let's dive into these concepts step by step, starting from the basics.

What is a Thread?
A thread is essentially a unit of execution within a program. When you run a Java program, there is at least one thread running: the main thread, which is responsible for executing the main() method. However, in Java, you can create multiple threads to perform different tasks concurrently.

In simple terms, think of a thread as a path of execution, like a worker in a factory that performs a specific task. You can have multiple workers (threads) working on different tasks at the same time, which makes the overall work get done faster.

What is Multithreading?
Multithreading is the ability of a program (or process) to execute multiple threads concurrently. Each thread runs independently but shares the same memory space, allowing them to access and modify shared resources like variables or files. Multithreading improves the efficiency and responsiveness of a program, especially in tasks that can be performed simultaneously (e.g., reading files, processing data, running animations, etc.).

In a multithreaded environment, multiple tasks are broken down into threads, which can run in parallel or be switched between by the CPU.


Key Concepts of Threads and Multithreading:
Concurrency:

Multiple threads run concurrently, which means they are executed in an overlapping manner, giving the illusion that multiple tasks are happening at the same time. However, this depends on the number of CPU cores and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) scheduler.
Parallelism:

In a multicore processor, threads can truly run in parallel, where each thread gets executed by a different CPU core at the same time.
Thread Lifecycle: A thread goes through several stages during its lifecycle:

New: The thread is created but not yet started.
Runnable: The thread is ready to run, but waiting for CPU time.
Running: The thread is actively running and executing its task.
Blocked/Waiting: The thread is waiting for a resource or to complete some I/O operation.
Terminated: The thread has finished its execution
