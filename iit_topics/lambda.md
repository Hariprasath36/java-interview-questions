What is a Lambda Expression?
A lambda expression is like a shortcut for writing small pieces of code that perform a specific task, without having to create a whole new class or method. It makes your code simpler and shorter.

You can think of it as a quick way to create a function that can be passed around in your program.

Why Do We Use Lambdas?

Before Java 8, whenever you wanted to create a simple function to pass as an argument or use somewhere, you had to write a lot of extra code. Lambdas make this much easier. They are mainly used with functional interfaces, which are interfaces that have just one method.

Basic Syntax of Lambda:

(parameters) -> { body of the function }
