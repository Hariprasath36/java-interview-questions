In Java, cloning refers to creating a copy of an object. Java provides a mechanism for object cloning using the clone() method from the Object class. The clone() method creates a shallow copy of the object, meaning it copies the values of primitive fields, but for objects and arrays, it copies only references, not the actual objects. If deep cloning is needed, a custom implementation is required.

Steps for Object Cloning in Java:
Implement Cloneable Interface: A class must implement the Cloneable interface to allow its objects to be cloned. This interface is a marker interface (it does not have any methods) but indicates to the JVM that the class allows cloning.

Override the clone() Method: The clone() method must be overridden to make the clone() method accessible outside the Object class and to handle the copying of fields if necessary.

Call super.clone(): In the overridden method, call super.clone() to get a shallow copy of the object.

Shallow Cloning vs Deep Cloning:
Shallow Cloning: Copies the object and its primitive data fields, but references to objects are copied rather than the actual objects. Thus, both the original and cloned objects share the same referenced objects.

Deep Cloning: In deep cloning, you manually create new instances of objects referenced by the original object, so that the cloned object does not share any referenced objects with the original.

Key Points:

Implement Cloneable interface to enable cloning.
Override the clone() method to customize cloning behavior.
Use super.clone() to perform shallow copying.
For deep cloning, manually clone referenced objects within the clone() method.
