1)JRE
java runtime environment byte code to machine lang
jdk(java development kit) it contains javac(compiler)
jvm(java virtual machine) byte code to machine lang
jre(java runtime environment)it contains libraries

2)public = main method can be accessed outside the class
static = we can invoke the main method without creating the object 
void = we cannot runturn a value
main = it is the entry point of the java program

3) what is java 
java is a high level programing lang
it is object oriented programing lang(object,class,inheritance,abstraction,encapsulation,polymorphism)

4)main features and advantage of java
platform independent
object-oriented
robust (automatic memory management) and secure
multi-threading
rich standard library

5)wht is java byte code
0,1


6)variables and data types &types
variables are used to store data (values)
data types define the type of variables

7)diff between primitive and non primitive (reference type)
primitive data type store actual value (stack) in memory || reference data type store reference (heap) of the values

primitive data types mostly hold single values || reference data type can hold multiple values

primitive data types have fixed storage || reference data type can have variable storage

primitive data types are stored on the stack memory || reference data type are stored on the heap memory

CONTROL STATEMENTS STRINGS AND ARRAYS

8)control statements in java
conditional statements : if-else,switch,ternary
looping statements : for,while,do-while,for each
branching statements : break,continue,return

9) when to use which type of control statements in real time
if-else =complex,multiple condition
ternary operator= condition?result1:result2; good for simple condition
switch=switch is best for same left values

10)what is StringBuilder?
it is mutable but string is immutable

10)What is array?
array is a data type that allows you to store multiple values in a single variable

array are used to store related data in a structured way

CLASSES,OBJECTS,ACCESS SPECIFIRES

11) what is oops?what are the main concepts of oops?
stands for object oriented programming ,it is a way to create software around objects.
oops provide a clear structure for the software's and web application

12)Access specifiers
public 
private
protected
default

13)this keyword?
this keyword refers to the current instance of the class
it differentiate beween instance variable and parameter withe same name in setter method 

14)Getter and setter methods?
getter methods are used to rettrive the values of private fiels of a class
setter method is used to modify or set the value of a priavte fiels of a class

OOPS- INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM

15) what is inheritance and when to use inheritance in real applications?
inheritance is creating a parent-child relationship between two classes,where child class will automatically get the properties and methods of the parent
1)code reusability:multiple subclass can reuse fields and methods from a superclass

16)Types of inheritance?
Single inheritance
Multilevel inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance
Hybrid inheritance

17)What is the alternative of multiple inheritance in java?
java supports multiple inheritance by using interfaces.So multiple interfaces and maximum one parent calss can be inherited

18)Types of polymorphism?
Compile time polymorphism 1)method overloading 
Runtime polymorphism 1)method overriding

19)Difference between overloading and overriding
multiple methods with same name are in same class || multiple methods with same name are in different class

Methods have the same name but different parameter lists || methods have the same name and same parameter list

compile-time polymorphism || Runtime polymorphism

No annotation or special keyword is required || @Overide annotation is used  over method of child class to specify that it's overriding a superclass method

Constructor can also be overloaded || Constructor cannot be overloaded

OOPS - ENCASPSULATION AND ABSTRACTION

20)what is encapsulation?
is a bundling of data and methods in a single unit

21)How to achieve encapsulation in java
encapsulation can be achieved by using access modifier(private) and getter an dsetter methods

22)What is abstraction? how to implement?
it is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user
mostly we use abstract class and interface for implementing abstraction

23)Difference between abstract class and interface
cannot be instantiated directly with new keyword its for both 

defined by using interface keyword || defined by using abstract keyword

supportsmultiple inheritance || support single inheritance

methods are implicitly abstract || use abstract keyword to make methods abstract

cannot have constructors || can have constructors

can have default methods || cannot have default methods
