1)wht is JIT-
 Just in Time Compiler

2)wht is ClassLoader - 
is a subsystem of java virtual machine,dedicated to load class files when a program is executed

3)Memory allocation available in java - 
heap memory, stack memory,class memory, method memory,Program counter memory

4)Will the program run if i write static public void main?
yes,the program will successfully executed if written so because in java there is no specific rule for order of specifiers

5)what is a default value stored in a local variable?
any values can be stored in a local variable

6)Association ?
is realtiomship that has no ownership over another object

7)Copy constructor?
is a constructor that initializes an object through another object of the same class

8)Marker interface?
an empty intreface is called as marker interface

9)Object cloning?
 an ability to recreate an object completly similar to an  existing object

 10)Y java is not completely object oriented?
 java is not 100% completely object oriented because it still makes use of eight or more primitive data types like int,float, char

 11)Wrapper class?
 when you declrare a variable of a primitive data type wrapper class are responsible for coverting them into object

 12)Singleton class?
 In java when you make the constructor of a class is priavte then that particular class can generate only one single 
 object its called singleton cls

 13)Package in java?
  Package is a collection of classes and interfaces along with the necessary libraries and jar files

  14)can u implement pointers in java?
  jvm takes care of memory management in java,java's main motto was to keep program simple ,so accessing memory through pointers is not recommended ,hence in java pointers are eliminated

  15)Diff between instance and local variables?
  instance variables are declared inside a class and the scope is limited to only a specific object
  local variables can be anywhere inside a method or specific block of code  

 16) java Sring pool?
 a collection of strings in java's heap memory is refered as java string pool

 17)Exception?
 is considered as an unexpected event that can disrupt the normal flow of the program ,this can be fixed using exception handalling

 18)final keyword?
  the term final is a predefined word in java that is used while declaring values to variables .when a value is declared using final keyword then the value  of the variable remains as constant throught the excution of program

  19) wht happens when main() isn't declared as static?
  when a main method is not declared  as static then porgram may br compiled perfectly bt ends up with a serious ambiguity and throws a run time error that reads "nosuchmethoderror"

INTERMEDIATE LVL

  20)JDK
  java development kit it is used to combaine pacakge of jre and developer tools used for designing java application
  1)jdk standard edition
  2)jdk enterprise edition
  3)jdk micro edition

  21) Acess specifiers
  1)public 
  2)pirvate
  3)protected
  4)Default

  22) can a constructor return a value
  yes constructor can return a value ,it returns the current instance of the class 

  23)this keyword
  it is a reference keyword,it is used to refer to the current class properties like methods,varaiable amd constructor

  24) super keyword
  it also a reference keyword used to refer the immediate parent class object

  25)Method overloading
  creating multiple method signatures using one method name bt return-tyoe only varies

  26)can we overload a static method
  no,in java we cannot overload the static method

  27)late binding 
  binding is a process of unifying the method call with the methods code segment. Late binding happens when the method code segment is unknow till the method is called during the run-time

  28)Dynamic method dispatch
  dynamic method dispatch is a process where the method call is executed during the run-time

  29)Y delete function faster in linked list  than array?
  delete function is faster in linked lists as the user needs to make a minor update to the pointer value so that the node can point to the next successor in the list

  30)lyf cycle of a thread
  new born state
  runnable
  running
  blocked
  dead

  31)>> and >>> diff
  >> operator does the job of right shifting the sign bits
  >>> operator is uesd tp shift out the zero filled bits

  32)lyf cycle of applet
  initialization
  start
  stop
  destory
  paint

  33)Y generics used in java
  compile-time type safety is provided by using generics,this allows users to catch unnecessary invalid types at complie time

  34)Deamon thread
  it is a thread with least priority.this daemon thread is designed to run in the background during the process of garbage collecion

  35)ennumerate in java
  enumerate or enum is a interface in java .it allows the sequential access of the elements stored in a collection in java

  36)Y java is dynamic in nature
java is designed to adapt to an evolving environment,java programs include large amt of run-time information that is used to resolve access tp objects in real-time

37)how many times the finalize method called
it is called by the garbage collector just one for a time

ADVANCED

38)can this and super keyword be uesd together
no keyword should be used in the first statement in class constructor

39)JSP
java servlet page
consist of static data
jsp elements

40)jdbc
java database connector

41)various directives in jsp
include
page


42)Session management
it is a dynamic state of random conversation between the client and the server

43)spring framework
Spring is essentialli defined as an application framework and inversion of control container for java.the chief purpose of the spring framework is to create enterprise applications in java

44)jca
java cryptography architecture, used to encrypt and decrypt

45)jpa
java persistance api
used to create  the persistence layer for desktop and web applicatin

46)diff authentications in java servlets
baseic authenticate
form-based
digest authentication
client certificate authentication
