1)JRE
java runtime environment byte code to machine lang
jdk(java development kit) it contains javac(compiler)
jvm(java virtual machine) byte code to machine lang
jre(java runtime environment)it contains libraries

2)public = main method can be accessed outside the class
static = we can invoke the main method without creating the object 
void = we cannot runturn a value
main = it is the entry point of the java program

3) what is java 
java is a high level programing lang
it is object oriented programing lang(object,class,inheritance,abstraction,encapsulation,polymorphism)

4)main features and advantage of java
platform independent
object-oriented
robust (automatic memory management) and secure
multi-threading
rich standard library

5)wht is java byte code
0,1

6)variables and data types &types
variables are used to store data (values)
data types define the type of variables

7)diff between primitive and non primitive (reference type)
primitive data type store actual value (stack) in memory || reference data type store reference (heap) of the values

primitive data types mostly hold single values || reference data type can hold multiple values

primitive data types have fixed storage || reference data type can have variable storage

primitive data types are stored on the stack memory || reference data type are stored on the heap memory

CONTROL STATEMENTS STRINGS AND ARRAYS

8)control statements in java
conditional statements : if-else,switch,ternary
looping statements : for,while,do-while,for each
branching statements : break,continue,return

9) when to use which type of control statements in real time
if-else =complex,multiple condition
ternary operator= condition?result1:result2; good for simple condition
switch=switch is best for same left values

10)what is StringBuilder?
it is mutable but string is immutable

10)What is array?
array is a data type that allows you to store multiple values in a single variable

array are used to store related data in a structured way

CLASSES,OBJECTS,ACCESS SPECIFIRES

11) what is oops?what are the main concepts of oops?
stands for object oriented programming ,it is a way to create software around objects.
oops provide a clear structure for the software's and web application

12)Access specifiers
public 
private
protected
default

13)this keyword?
this keyword refers to the current instance of the class
it differentiate beween instance variable and parameter withe same name in setter method 

14)Getter and setter methods?
getter method is used to get the value of instance variable
